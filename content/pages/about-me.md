I'm a soon-to-be-graduating senior at Stevens Institute of Technology, studying Computer Science. Strong passion for ed-tech, so this is where I'll be documenting the effort I'm making towards pursuing that passion. Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:ksaleem@stevens.edu).

You can find my resume [here](./static/resume.html).
