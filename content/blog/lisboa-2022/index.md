Towards the end of 2022, I was wrapping up a 3 month Euro tour, and my travel buddy and I were considering the next destination. Truth be told, there wasn't too much thought put into choosing Lisbon as a destination, but we were just hoping to catch some warm weather for the last stretch of our trip, so southern Europe was a good fit. 

Though the decision was made on a whim, Lisbon ended up being one of the most gorgeous and engaging places I've ever visited. This was one of the only destinations on the route I felt I could truly make a home in. We ended up staying for a month, in the Estrela district, Santos-o-Velho neighborhood on Rua da Esperan√ßa. This was an excellent base-camp for all of my exploration in Lisbon, centrally located, close to transit like the Santos rail station, steps away from the historic Lisbon street trams, tons of coffee shops like [Buna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vCwsoy1tLSP8FV74A), [Hello, Kristof](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GYDEiToU9PdfHMpc6), and [Neighborhood Lisbon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cCCYGUsv9XA61Jsp7).
