This is the beginning of a series on architecting and developing enterprise-ready microservices. This content will be refined continuously over the next few weeks, and should not be interpreted as ready for consumption outside of a limited audience.

The current intended audience is for people that are code-familiar, but have not thoroughly forayed into large-scale enterprise microservice development. The expectation is that by the end of this series, the learner will have developed enough skills to be able to make contributions to enterprise microservice codebases.
