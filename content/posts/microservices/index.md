## Overview

In July of last year, I joined a large firm as a software engineer. I was exposed to large-scale applications for the first time, and was able to shed my pre-existing biases against Java and Spring Boot as "old-school" or antiquated backend technologies. Additionally, I learned a considerable amount about developing large-scale applications using a microservice architecture.

The goal of this series is to share lessons learned about enterprise microservice architectures, and best-practices for developing a platform with Java and Spring Boot.

## Why Java + Spring ?

This is the beginning of a series on architecting and developing enterprise-ready microservices. This content will be refined continuously over the next few weeks, and should not be interpreted as ready for consumption outside of a limited audience.

The current intended audience is for people that are code-familiar, but have not thoroughly forayed into large-scale enterprise microservice development. The expectation is that by the end of this series, the learner will have developed enough skills to be able to make contributions to enterprise microservice codebases.
