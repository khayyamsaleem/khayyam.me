## What is this?
At the company where I work, there is a leadership-development program designed to help high-potential
participants solve problems at the intersection of business, leadership, and technology. This post is my way of representing
myself beyond the bounds of the application form.

I'll use this medium to discuss my journey with technology, and what lessons I've picked up along the way.

## My first encounter with software engineering
My journey with technology actually began with a **total flop**.

As an excited 16 year old, I attended a hackathon hosted by a local high school, where a bunch of high schoolers from 
all throughout NJ came to learn about tech or write some code while eating free snacks from sponsors, for 24 hours in a
gymnasium. It sounded like a lot of fun, but I had zero programming experience. I was always a tinkerer and knew a bunch about 
how to USE software, but very little about how to BUILD it.

I expected that would be the case for a lot of the attendees, as they were all young. But no, I was instead thoroughly **humbled**.
Everyone came to _compete_, and they came up with wild and crazy ideas like making a 3D scanner out of old CD player lasers, or a
VR racing game (back when VR development was a lot harder). 

In the end, our team ended up [winning](https://hackbca2014.devpost.com/submissions/22004-guardianangel) a small sponsor prize, but it
was no thanks to me. I was completely out of my league and all that I was able to contribute was a cute logo.

<br/>

I thought that in those 24 hours, I learned nothing. But instead, I think I had my first proper **[Socratic revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing)**.

## Changing the scene
After the hackathon, I sought out to change how little I knew. With my ego out of the way, I could focus on improving my skillset.

In college, I worked hard to ace my CS classes. I was studying often and writing code nightly and passing all the test cases.

But then, my next big folly: it became all about the **grade**. Rather than retaining information or abstracting concepts, I was just
finishing the homework and getting the A and dumping all the content after that.

Not only was I **not** learning valuable skills; I was also falling into the dangerous trap of THINKING that I was, because of the validation 
from the grades. I needed something to re-frame what technology meant to me, and find a better motivation to keep doing it.

## Finding community in technology
After my first semester, I started teaching as a tutor in the college library, and took up a role as a teaching assistant. This experience
allowed me to reinforce every concept I learned by teaching, and also allowed me to inspire an interest in technology in my students beyond
just the content in the class. It was this knowledge-sharing experience that showed me a side of tech that I hadn't seen before: the community.

It was a community of learners; of curious people that wanted to apply their skills to solve problems. I found this community in my students, 
in online forums like Reddit and HackerNews, and at conferences and developer meetups. The technology community helped me develop my voice and 
opinions about tech and what it was good for, and what it meant to me. I attended more hackathons, in a more useful capacity this time, and thrived
off of the [collective effervescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_effervescence) in the atmosphere.

## Finding expression in technology
Beyond just helping me feel part of a community, part of my technology journey has also been more creative and expressive. I have always been a 
writer at heart, and technology helped me share my writing in the form of this blog (and many before it, which shall remain secret for as long as
the internet will allow). I was also able to express through the content I would write during my tenure as a content contributor at 
[Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/khayyamsaleem).

More recently, in my exploration of IoT and embedded systems, technology allowed me to create interactive and artistic installations. I won't go into 
too much detail, but they did get pretty cool.

## Finding career in technology
After school and with an internship at JPMC under my belt, I joined full-time. Here, under a [great mentor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrdoomsbuster/),
I was able to combine the humility, community, expression, and expertise that I had developed throughout my journey in technology, and put it to use
to solve problems for the business. 

The actual contributions I made can be observed through my commit history, but what is harder to represent is the cultural changes that I tried to 
instill. Though I have strong opinions sometimes, I learned at JPMC how to share those opinions in a respectful and productive way, and how to accomodate
difference and diversity of background in the way that I teach.

My technology journey has been short but eventful. Even today, I continue forming very strong relationships with my colleagues across the different teams 
that I've worked on, and even maintaining that rapport as I move between teams. I participate actively in the Symphony rooms that have helped me. I conduct 
workshops for new technologies that I've been able to figure out. And above all, I encourage creative approaches to the problems we face because innovation 
is at the core of why JPMC has been so successful with its investments in technology and people.
