I want to try out this new blog format. Since I've really started to enjoy org-mode in emacs, and I think that the themes in [[http://gohugo.io][Hugo]] seemed pretty, this was a natural choice. *Will* post a tutorial about my blog creation and deployment soon. Just a test for now.

**** Source Blocks

Below is a demo of a source block and its execution.

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
  let rec fact_h x acc = match x with
    | 1 -> acc
    | n -> fact_h (n-1) (n*acc) in
      let fact y = fact_h y 1 in
      fact 5
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120

**** Tables

Here's a demo of an org-mode table:

| Index | Value |
|-------|-------|
|     0 |     1 |
|     1 |     1 |
|     2 |     2 |
|     3 |     6 |
|     4 |    24 |
|     5 |   120 |

This site is built with Hugo on org-mode. The site is deployed on a DigitalOcean droplet. The intent is to have it build with Jenkins and automatically update the site every time I push to master. As of now, I've been able to set up a CI/CD workflow. Currently working on adding git-hooks. It has been a wild ride.

**** Getting Started
First, prioritize getting everything going on your local version. Don't prioritize deployment until you at least have something to show, because it is quite a hassle to get going in the beginning.\\
After you've got your project working locally, you can figure out all the details of your deployment.\\

1) Do you want a static site? What else needs to be running for your application to work?
2) Do you want to deploy to the same server as your build server? Or would you like it to end up on another droplet or VPS?
3) Are you ready to hate yourself for hours?
4) This is mostly just sample text to test the webhooks, I will write a real tutorial later.
5) Now I'm trying out merging a pull-request. Still no public good has been done.

Traefik is a reverse proxy that can help you deploy lots of things at once on your VPS.

This blog is deployed with nginx serving a static folder. Nginx is a lightweight, powerful web server for both static and dynamic content.

With Traefik, I am able to orchestrate many services on a single VPS, without having to pay per droplet for each service that I wish to deploy
